📊 Marketing Campaign Effectiveness Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes digital marketing campaign performance across multiple channels to understand which campaigns create value, which waste budget, and how marketing spend can be optimized.

The project is designed from a Business Analyst perspective, focusing on metrics, insights, and decision-making rather than just calculations.

🎯 Business Problem

The company runs marketing campaigns across Email, Social Media, and Paid Ads but lacks clarity on:

Which channels deliver the best ROI

Which campaign types perform better

Where marketing budget is being inefficiently spent

This analysis helps answer these questions using data.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains 120 marketing campaign records with realistic performance patterns.

Key columns:

campaign_id

date

channel

campaign_type

region

impressions

📐 Key Metrics Used

The following metrics were calculated to evaluate performance:

CTR (Click Through Rate) = clicks / impressions

Conversion Rate = conversions / clicks

CPA (Cost Per Conversion) = cost / conversions

ROI (Return on Investment) = (revenue − cost) / cost

These metrics form the foundation of all insights and recommendations.
