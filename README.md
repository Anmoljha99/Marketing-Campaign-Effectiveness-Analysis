📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the performance of digital marketing campaigns across different channels such as Email, Social Media, and Paid Ads. The objective is to understand which campaigns are actually delivering value and where marketing efforts can be optimized using data-driven insights.

🎯 Business Problem

The company runs multiple marketing campaigns but lacks clear visibility into:

Which campaigns generate meaningful returns

Which channels convert users efficiently

Whether marketing spend is being used effectively

This analysis helps bridge that gap by evaluating campaign performance using key business metrics.

📊 Dataset Description

It includes the following fields:

Campaign ID

Marketing Channel (Email, Social Media, Paid Ads)

Impressions

Clicks

Conversions

Campaign Cost

Revenue Generated

📐 Metrics Used

To evaluate campaign effectiveness, the following metrics were calculated:

Click Through Rate (CTR): Measures how often users click on ads after seeing them

Conversion Rate: Indicates how many clicks convert into actual outcomes

Cost Per Conversion (CPA): Shows the cost incurred to acquire one conversion

Return on Investment (ROI): Evaluates profitability of each campaign

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, pivot tables, dashboards

SQL – Aggregations and campaign-level analysis

Python (optional) – Data visualization and deeper analysis

🔍 Analysis Approach

Cleaned and validated campaign data to ensure accuracy

Calculated key performance metrics for each campaign
